# Future Improvements

This document tracks planned enhancements and future features for WhimCraft.

## Low Priority

### 1. Notion-like Whim Editing Experience - Phase 2 Enhancements

**Description**: Add advanced Notion-like features to the TipTap editor. Phase 1 (LaTeX, code highlighting, tables, images) is already complete.

**Current State**:
- ✅ TipTap WYSIWYG editor implemented
- ✅ LaTeX math support (inline and block)
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- ✅ Table creation and editing
- ✅ Image support
- ✅ Basic formatting (bold, italic, headings, lists)

**Phase 2 Enhancements** (Nice-to-have):
1. **Slash Commands**
   - Type `/` to insert blocks (heading, list, code, table, etc.)
   - Searchable command palette

2. **Drag & Drop Blocks**
   - Reorder paragraphs, headings, lists by dragging
   - Visual drop indicators

3. **Video Embedding**
   - Support YouTube, Vimeo URLs
   - Responsive embeds

4. **Enhanced Code Blocks**
   - Line numbers
   - Copy button
   - Language badge

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced user experience with Notion-like polish
- Faster content organization with drag & drop
- Quick formatting with slash commands

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Cost Impact**: None (all client-side)

**Priority Rationale**:
This is LOW PRIORITY because Phase 1 already provides core functionality. These are polish features that can be added later.
